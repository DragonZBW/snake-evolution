# Snake Evolution
It's everyone's favorite snake game, now with FAKE BRAINS!

## About
Snake evolution is like snake, but played by the computer! This project uses neural networks and a genetic algorithm to produce artificially intelligent snakes that will attempt to navigate their boards, eat food, and avoid walls.
